# MES Implementation Gaps Analysis

## Executive Summary

The MES system implementation is **~35% complete** when measured against standard MES functionality. While the core workflow (routings → orders → work operations) is solid, **most fundamental MES features are missing**. The system implements basic shop floor execution but lacks material management, quality control, equipment tracking, and compliance features required for a complete MES.

**Key Finding**: This is more of a **Work Order Management System** than a full MES. Significant additional development is needed to meet standard MES requirements.

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Start with Operations Management UI** - This is the highest impact gap
2. **Create routing operations page** at `/dashboard/[teamId]/routings/[id]/operations`
3. **Add operation creation form** with department selection and time estimates
4. **Test full workflow** from routing creation → operation creation → order generation

## **TECHNICAL NOTES**

- Database schemas are complete for implemented features but missing entire MES domains
- API endpoints exist for current features but new entities needed for full MES
- Main gaps are fundamental MES features, not just UI/UX
- System architecture is solid and scalable for expansion
- Ready for pilot as Work Order Management System, not full MES

## **RISK ASSESSMENT**

- **HIGH RISK**: Missing fundamental MES features (material management, quality control)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: System may be misunderstood as complete when it's only 35% of full MES
- **LOW RISK**: Core workflow execution is solid and functional

**Overall Assessment**: System is a solid Work Order Management System but requires significant development to become a complete MES. Consider positioning as "Phase 1 MES" or "Shop Floor Execution System" until standard MES features are implemented.
